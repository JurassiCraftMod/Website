    <p>
      JurassiCraft is a mod based on Jurassic Park on Jurassic World franchises, but is not only limited to it. This mod allows you 
	  to create dinosaurs by extracting DNA from fossils and amber, and putting that through a process until you get a baby dinosaur! 
	  Not only does this mod add dinosaurs, it also adds many prehistoric plants! Currently, this mod contains only 10 dinosaurs, 
	  but more will be added in the future!<br><br>
