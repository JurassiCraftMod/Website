    <p> JurassiCraft is a mod based on Jurassic Park on Jurassic World franchises, but is not only limited to it.<br> 
	This mod allows you to create dinosaurs by extracting DNA from fossils and amber, and putting that through a<br>
	process until you get a baby dinosaur! Not only does this mod add dinosaurs, it also adds many prehistoric plants!</p>
