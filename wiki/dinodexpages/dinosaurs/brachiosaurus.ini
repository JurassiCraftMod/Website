desc = One of the most popular sauropods the Brachiosaurus is one of the largest herbivores you will come across.  They gather around forests and plains with other creatures from the Hadrosaurid family. Brachiosaurus creatures had long necks that made it easy for them to graze the top of tall trees. Occasionally a male and female will breed and can produce up to 4-8 eggs in one clutch. Because of their massive size, you might have trouble containing them, however, if you have a good amount of trees for food and enough space you should be able to satisfy them.
